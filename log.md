# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 Days Of Code Challenge by forking the repo and updating the log. Learned how to push changes in using VS Code and created a tentative roadmap of the challenge in Notion.

**Thoughts:** The Markdown syntax is pleasant to deal with (the simplicity of the heading hierarchy is simple yet effective). VS Code is a lot more robust than I thought what with its ability to handle version control. Hope I can make it through this challenge! I've always had a lot of trouble sticking and committing to my self-learning initiatives and projects so when I heard about a challenge that's specifically for people who tend to shift focus like me. The premise of the challenge is simple and its easy enough to get started.

### Day 1: July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did some freeCodeCamp challenges for Javascript from the Basic Javascript track from "Golf Code" to "Record Collection". Learned mostly on `switch` statements, Javascript object notations, access and property notations.

**Thoughts**: Javascript has an easily confusable way to access its objects either via the dot notation (e.g. myObject.myProperty) and the more robust (e.g. myObject\[myProperty\]), which lead to some difficulty when tackling "Record Collection". Specifically, what's important for me to remember is that variable names are not accessible via the dot notation and only by the square bracket notation.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
