# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 14: 12 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished 2 parts of the TraversyMedia's DOM tutorial.

**Thoughts**: DOM methods are straightforward and easy to use. Having the `querySelector` method in vanilla Javascript will allow me to work with my preferred syntax without having to include any external JQuery libraries. Learnt the difference on the `window`, `document` and `screen` objects in Javascript too.

### Day 13: 11 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the frontend for Form Validator and started going through [TraversyMedia's DOM tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ik6X4DJKCc&list=PLillGF-RfqbYE6Ik_EuXA2iZFcE082B3s) on Youtube.

**Thoughts**: Happy with the outcome of the Form Validator's frontend (though I wish the form validation text could have a little more animation to it such as Airtable's registration page where it slides the other elements down when there's an error) and the DOM manipulation techniques will help in completing this mini-project. Looking around for the error in form validations at various major tech companies' landing pages shows that there is currently no best practice in displaying the error as they are all different. I've also started to thinking about hosting the mini-projects that I'm doing as a site, but I'm still considering the options as I may want to involve Django in the project and there's no free hosting for that.

### Day 12: 10 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through about 75% of the Javascript Regex module and worked on the Form Validator project a little bit.

**Thoughts**: Basic regex as a concept is not a hard topic to grasp but requires some revising due to the amount of different meanings of common character symbols.

### Day 11: 9 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about `border-box`, revised some elements on Forms to recreate the HTML & CSS [Form Validator](https://vanillawebprojects.com/projects/form-validator/) from the 20 Vanilla Web Projects.

**Thoughts**: Applying some of the previously learned materials from the freeCodeCamp modules to an actual mini-project is cementing them much better. My initial thought for the best way to perform the validation on the fields would be via regex.

### Day 10: 8 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS Flex and Responsive Web Design module and started on the CSS Grid module.

**Thoughts**: The freeCodeCamp modules on Media Queries, Flex and Grid seem to only teach the basics and not the real world use. Will have to explore real-world use cases on my own.

### Day 9: 6 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished revising HTML & CSS from the video in Day 6. Learned about Media Queries briefly and started on the Flexbox module in CSS.

**Thoughts**: Creating a responsive website seems to be a lot more manual than I thought and requires a degree of experimentation and eyeballing. Flexbox is such a dynamic tool that it its enough to just use it to create beautiful and dynamic layouts without having to resort to frameworks.

### Day 8: 5 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Algorithm Challenges in the Javascript module.

**Thoughts**: Learned about the `.sort()` function for arrays.

### Day 7: 4 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Algorithm Challenges in the Javascript module.

**Thoughts**: `.splice()` methods are the easiest way to delete values in an array. Javascript has a concept of 'falsy' values, which is something foreign coming from strongly typed languages.

### Day 6: 3 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through 5 algorithm challenges in the Javascript module. Revised some HTML & CSS materials by going through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeDP-rzOnAA) tutorial for a responsive website using vanilla HTML & CSS. 

**Thoughts**: The myriad of ways that you can solve the same problem is interesting. The `.map()` and `.reduce()` functions are seemingly often used in these kinds of challenges and I'm going to look more into that. Flexbox's `align-items` and `justify-content` seem to be its most important properties.

### Day 5: 2 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the data structures module on the Javascript track.

**Thoughts**: I'm wondering what the performance are for these atomic operations such as `slice`, `splice` and `indexOf()` and if there are any downsides to using the built-in methods.

### Day 4: 1 August, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the ES6 modules covering string literals, classes, Promises and exports, the entire debugging module and also some data structures.

**Thoughts**: Promises are a stand out to me as something to delve deeper into. Exports seemed to have been born out of a necessity to cater for server-side Javascript logic.

### Day 3: 31 July, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the freeCodeCamp recursion lessons, and started learning ES6 Javascript syntax such as arrow functions, let and const keywords and destructuring syntax.

**Thoughts**: Made some good progress on understanding recursion (it's starting to 'click'!) and ES6 seems to have many features that revolve around manipulating objects and arrays and generally a good addition to make any web developer's life easier. Being able to use the destructuring assignment in the parameter of a function seems shockingly easy. Loving that flexibility to manipulate an object's representation.

### Day 2: 29 July, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued more freeCodeCamp challenges focusing on loops, recursion and the ternary operator.

**Thoughts**: Good refresher on all the content, as the syntax is mostly as it is in Java. Going to study more on some prerequisite knowledge on recursion (from [this](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/freecodecamp-challenge-guide-use-recursion-to-create-a-countdown/305925) freeCodeCamp forum post) before continuing on to the next challenge to ensure I'm well equipped to tackle the problem.

### Day 1: 28 July, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did some freeCodeCamp challenges for Javascript from the Basic Javascript track from "Golf Code" to "Record Collection". Learned mostly on `switch` statements, Javascript object notations, access and property notations.

**Thoughts**: Javascript has an easily confusable way to access its objects either via the dot notation (e.g. myObject.myProperty) and the more robust square bracket notation (e.g. myObject\[myProperty\]), which lead to some difficulty when tackling "Record Collection". Specifically, what's important for me to remember is that variable names are not accessible via the dot notation and only by the square bracket notation.

### Day 0: 27 July, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 Days Of Code Challenge by forking the repo and updating the log. Learned how to push changes in using VS Code and created a tentative roadmap of the challenge in Notion.

**Thoughts:** The Markdown syntax is pleasant to deal with (the simplicity of the heading hierarchy is simple yet effective). VS Code is a lot more robust than I thought what with its ability to handle version control. Hope I can make it through this challenge! I've always had a lot of trouble sticking and committing to my self-learning initiatives and projects so when I heard about a challenge that's specifically for people who tend to shift focus like me. The premise of the challenge is simple and its easy enough to get started.

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
